# SC OrderBook

## What Is It?
[Level 2 order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/level2.asp) implemented in Python using [Sorted Containers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/) mainly for analysis.  
The goal is not to implement all order book operations, rather to be able to query and get relevant information quickly.  

Partially inspired by [HFT-Orderbook](https://github.com/Crypto-toolbox/HFT-Orderbook)
